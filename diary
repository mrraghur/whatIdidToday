Tried to understand LLVM compiler.

Typed and executed the code in LLVM tutorial (Until chapter -3 LLVM codegen)

Wrote a script for finding similar documents. Given 'n' documents....Make histogram of word distribution 
in each document. Write output to a CSV file and then plot the same to excel chart. 

For the one news event, three documents on arun jaitley that I tested, two of the histograms were very similar.

code coverage based debugger.
As a first step to writing a debugger that color-codes which lines have been executed...I wrote a perl script which 
keeps tracks of which branch a given if condition takes. The original input script is written out
as a HTML file with "taken branches" being showing up as red.

Improved upon the code codeverage based debugger tool above. Earlier I was looking for code "blocks" (code with 
brackets) using Regex. Now that is replaced by perl PPI module. I can now track which If statements and which next
statements have been executed. I am happy with the progress.

Now I need to use a proper code coverage tool for taking this to next level. Unfortunately, I don't know 
which language to pick up.

Tried to play with ffmpeg. Adding scrolling and such stuff....Here are some commands for doing that...

Just add text...

Bottom to top scrolling
"C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFF\ffmpeg.exe" -y -i "C:\Users\ Romeo\Desktop\IMG_0696.MOV" -acodec libmp3lame -vcodec msmpeg4 -b:a 192k -b:v 1000k  -ar 44100  -vf "drawtext=fontfile=/Windows/Fonts/cambriai.ttf: x=(w-tw)/2: y=h-(2*lh)-n: fontcolor=white: fontsize=40: box=1: boxcolor=0x00000000@1: text=r" -an    "C:\Users\r Romeo\Documents\IMG_0696.avi"

No scrolling...text in top left corner
"C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFF\ffmpeg.exe" -y -i "C:\Users\ Romeo\Desktop\IMG_0696.MOV" -acodec libmp3lame -vcodec msmpeg4 -b:a 192k -b:v 1000k  -ar 44100  -vf "drawtext=fontfile=/Windows/Fonts/cambriai.ttf: fontcolor=white: fontsize=40: box=1: boxcolor=0x00000000@1: text=r is god" -an    "C:\Users\r Romeo\Documents\IMG_0696.avi"

ffmpeg -i in.mov -vf "drawtext=fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/ttf-bitstream-vera/Vera.ttf: x=(w-tw)/2: y=h-(2*lh)-n: fontcolor=white: fontsize=40: box=1: boxcolor=0x00000000@1: text=" -an -y out.mov

Frame number on eachframe (Not working)
"C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFF\ffmpeg.exe" -y -i "C:\Users\ Romeo\Desktop\IMG_0696.MOV" -acodec libmp3lame -vcodec msmpeg4 -b:a 192k -b:v 1000k  -ar 44100  -vf "drawtext=text=%{n}:expansion=normal:fontfile=/Windows/Fonts/cambriai.ttf: y=h-(2*lh)-n: x=h-(2*lh)-n: fontcolor=white: fontsize=40: box=1: boxcolor=0x00000000@1" -an    "C:\Users\r Romeo\Documents\IMG_0696.avi"

This seems to work reasonably well (banner scroll bar). Need to improve though.
"C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFF\ffmpeg.exe" -y -i "C:\Users\ Romeo\Desktop\IMG_0696.MOV" -acodec libmp3lame -vcodec msmpeg4 -b:a 192k -b:v 1000k  -ar 44100  -vf "drawtext=text=r wassup daaa news ycombinator huhahua  hula hoop america san francisco :expansion=normal:fontfile=/Windows/Fonts/cambriai.ttf: y=0: x=h-(2*lh)-n: fontcolor=white: fontsize=40: box=1: boxcolor=0x00000000@1" -an    "C:\Users\r Romeo\Documents\IMG_0696.avi"


This also works well
"C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFF\ffmpeg.exe" -y -i "C:\Users\ Romeo\Desktop\IMG_0696.MOV" -vf "drawtext=fontfile=/Windows/Fonts/cambriai.ttf:text=You should not be watching this:fontsize=40:fontcolor=white:shadowcolor=black:shadowx=1:shadowy=1:x=W*(1-0.2*t):y=H+descent-ascent"   -an -y "C:\Users\r Romeo\Documents\IMG_0696.avi"

Read a lot about GCC and figured that I can write a GCC plugin to do code coverage ...Will implement
it soon.

-------
Tried to contact Hotels for weather related project...

Wrote to imimobile and airsage for cell operators api/data.

Finally found something to use as an API for gcc parser.
Found gcc plugin through python. Tried some examples as below.

gcc  -fplugin=./python.so -fplugin-arg-python-script=../show-gimple.py -g ../test.c 

Now I need to make a code covergae thingy for it


Looks like good for overlaying

--------------------
Downloaded woboq code browser, modified it to fit my needs and got some designs to compile with it. Now, with 
code-coverage on, on a webpage, I get to see which lines are executed and which are not. Finally, I am moving forward.

---------
Worked with vlc to display RSS feeds on a video. Using chromecast, I can now display image on TV, in real time.
Also, I can make audio-bar graph show up on my videos. Unfortunately, 
this only works on linux. Windows, bar-graph, I have not figured yet.

----------
Integrated whatsapp API into linux. Now, I can send message from command line to mobile. #messaging
have a bit of scripting to do. 

Python: Spent lot of time installing date utils into my local login. It took too much time to use easy_setup, easy_install, setup.py etc
Finally ended up copying from my virtual machine to local login. Everything works fine now.

Learn Scaling
A set of tutorial to learn scaling big systems. How do you identify when you are paging in and out? How do you know when you are using more memory than is available on the machine (Tutorial for context switching)

How do you identify context switching? (Tutorial for context switching)

How do you identify VIP/load balancer not working well? What if a box is throwing too many 503s? Why does it get more calls than other boxes?

How do you determine ifa box is going bad and giving errors?

How do you cancel a request in the middle of processing?

How is the GC cycle? What is the time between GC cycles?

How does GC perform once we increase memory on the box

How do you know how many threads are running in your box/server?

** How many threads can a server handle **

Typically, 48 cores can handle about 1500. More than 2500, we will have context switching

Combining data two or more popular services. This helps in discovering new insights

For example, crunchbase is a huge database of companies and their current team members. Linkedin is a repository of current

   For example, youtube is a big database of videos, including educational ones. Wikipedia is a huge database of relationships between closely related entities. So, given a video on youtube (Eg: How do Tvs work. ), one can potentially go to history of TVs and then discovery of electroc mangentic waves. A few people would love a video "recommendation engine" based on this principle.

Crunchbase has funding  and success information on companies. Linkedin has work histories. One can identify people who are more likely to lead startup/team success and recommend them to startups looking to hire.

Tracking accuracy of predictions. If there is a service which makes any kind of prediction, an associated service would be to track accuracy of such a prediction. For example, weather.com, accuweather, many websites make weather predictions. Forecastwatch.com tracks accuracy of each of these services and makes monthly/weekly report. They charge based on data and any consulting requirements!

Applying new technology to problems too which we could not apply them before Applying computer vision al

Take an extremely costly item/service and see how you can bring its cost down? You can do this by increasing production volumes, or by removing some features or by changing its hardware/software etc. For example, mobile phones in early 2000s would have costed $3-400 with a small LCD screen for display. But now, smartphones cost less than that much. Along the way, number of people using smartphones has exploded.

Intercontinental travel would have take 6 months and cost you a fortune. Now people go from USA to India every holiday season in just under 24 hours.

startup manager questions. 

    Suppose you are big company and you get a mail from City telling you that the water is contaminated. What would you do? Would you give employees an off?

    Would you order water? Where will you get so much water from? How much will it cost? Who in the organization will pay for it?

    How will you manage food ?
